# Neural_networks_agh

This repository contains an implementation of neural networks built from the ground up as part of coursework at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow. The project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of neural networks, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and optimization techniques.

The network is trained and tested on the MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits, to classify the images into one of 10 categories (0-9).

## Key Features:
- Implementation of a simple feedforward neural network
- Backpropagation algorithm for training
- Support for multiple hidden layers
- MNIST dataset for training and evaluation

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- MNIST dataset (can be downloaded using `keras.datasets` or other sources)
